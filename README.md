#### Q. Where are my files being stored? What about privacy?

A. FileShake uses **your personal Google Drive storage** to store & share your files, all your shared files are stored in a folder named _FileShake_ in your personal Google Drive, and **only these specific shared files** are accessible to FileShake, nothing else, all your other personal files in your Google Drive **are not accessible** to FileShake, it can only access the files that are **shared by you via this app**. You can also manually visit the _FileShake_ folder in your personal Google Drive to view/modify/delete all the sahred files. And since this is a fully client-side app with no servers attached, everything stays in **your device & browser**, including your Google Account SignIn information, nothing is stored/collected by FileShake.

#### Q. Is the app free? Are there any restrictions?

A. FileShake is completely free & open-source, you can use it however you want. And as far as restrictions go, at once at a single time, you can only share upto 100 files totalling upto 1GB, but you can share unlimited number of times if you want to share even more files.
